## Detailed Risk Descriptions with Framework Alignment

1. **SQL Injection (ISO 27001, NIST PR.DS-1)**
   - **Risk**: SQL injection occurs when user inputs are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to execute malicious SQL queries.
   - **Relevant Frameworks**:  
     - **ISO 27001 A.12.2.1**: Protection from malicious code.
     - **NIST PR.DS-1**: Ensures the protection of sensitive data.
   - **Likelihood**: High
   - **Impact**: High (Could compromise the database and expose sensitive customer information)
   - **Mitigation**: Apply input validation, use prepared SQL statements, and implement proper error handling to prevent SQL injection.

2. **Insecure Session Management (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS 8.2)**
   - **Risk**: Sessions are not securely managed, leading to potential session hijacking and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
   - **Relevant Frameworks**:  
     - **ISO 27001 A.9.2.1**: Control access based on user responsibilities.
     - **PCI-DSS 8.2**: Secure session handling and authentication.
   - **Likelihood**: High
   - **Impact**: High (User sessions, including admin access, could be hijacked)
   - **Mitigation**: Implement HTTPS, secure session cookies, and enforce session timeouts. Align with PCI-DSS guidelines for strong session control.

3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (ISO 27001, NIST PR.AC-3)**
   - **Risk**: XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, affecting users who visit the page.
   - **Relevant Frameworks**:  
     - **ISO 27001 A.9.4.1**: Ensure proper access control to systems and applications.
     - **NIST PR.AC-3**: Control access to data.
   - **Likelihood**: High
   - **Impact**: Medium (Could steal user session tokens, or inject malicious scripts)
   - **Mitigation**: Escape special characters, validate user inputs, and use output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.

4. **Insufficient Access Controls (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS 7)**
   - **Risk**: Lack of role-based access control (RBAC) allows unauthorized users to access sensitive areas.
   - **Relevant Frameworks**:  
     - **ISO 27001 A.9.1.2**: Ensure access to systems is based on roles.
     - **PCI-DSS 7**: Implement strong access control measures.

5. **Lack of Data Encryption (PCI-DSS 3.4, ISO 27001 A.10.1.1, NIST PR.DS-2)**
   - **Risk**: Sensitive data, including payment information, is stored in plaintext, making it vulnerable to theft.
   - **Relevant Frameworks**:  
     - **PCI-DSS 3.4**: Encryption of stored cardholder data.
     - **ISO 27001 A.10.1.1**: Use cryptographic techniques to protect data.
     - **NIST PR.DS-2**: Protect sensitive data at rest.
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High (Exposed sensitive data could lead to financial loss and legal issues)
   - **Mitigation**: Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit, using strong cryptographic techniques.

6. **Weak Password Policy (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS 8.1)**
   - **Risk**: Weak password policies allow users to create easily guessable passwords, increasing the risk of account compromise.
   - **Relevant Frameworks**:  
     - **ISO 27001 A.9.4.3**: Ensure strong password management.
     - **PCI-DSS 8.1**: Enforce strong authentication for all systems.
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium (User accounts could be compromised via brute-force attacks)
   - **Mitigation**: Enforce strong password policies, including complexity and expiration requirements, and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Recommended Mitigations and Compliance

1. **SQL Injection**: Implement input validation and prepared statements to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities. Align with **ISO 27001** controls for protecting against malicious code and **NIST** for securing sensitive data.
  
2. **Session Management**: Implement secure session tokens and enforce HTTPS throughout the application. Ensure compliance with **PCI-DSS 8.2** for secure session management and user authentication.

3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Use output encoding and input validation to prevent XSS attacks. These mitigations align with **ISO 27001** and **NIST** controls for secure access and data handling.

4. **Access Controls**: Implement RBAC to restrict access to sensitive data, complying with **ISO 27001 A.9.1.2** and **PCI-DSS 7** access control requirements.

5. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit using strong cryptographic algorithms, as per **PCI-DSS 3.4** and **ISO 27001 A.10.1.1**.

6. **Password Policy**: Enforce strong password requirements and implement multi-factor authentication to reduce unauthorized access, meeting **PCI-DSS 8.1** and **ISO 27001** standards for password management.
